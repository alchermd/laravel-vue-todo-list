# Laravel Vue Todo-List

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for a simple Todo-List application built with Laravel and VueJS.

## Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to familiarize myself with the build tools and workflow of Laravel in context of building the front end with VueJS. The following technologies will be used to develop the application:

| Technology | Website | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VueJS | https://vuejs.org | Front end JavaScript framework |
| Bootstrap 4 | https://getbootstrap.com | CSS framework |
| Laravel | https://laravel.com | Server side framework |
| PostgreSQL | https://postgresql.org | Relational Data Store |
| PHPUnit | https://phpunit.de | PHP testing framework |
| Laravel Dusk | https://laravel.com/docs/dusk | End-to-end testing framework |

To ensure best practices, the following parameters are to be followed:

1. Code is written using the [Test-Driven Development](#) methodology.
2. Inject [underlying classes](https://laravel.com/docs/facades#facade-class-reference) instead of Laravel Facades.
3. Fully utilize [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/mix) (i.e. no stray assets in `/public`)
